public class Shortcuts {
	/*
	.get() and .navigate().to()
	 .get() - start a new session
	 .navigate(). - typical browser actions (refresh, back/forward, change URL)
	 
	.close() and .quit()
	 .close() - closes the window
	 .quit() - destroys the WebDriver instance
	 
	java & variable definition
	 declaration (String firstName)
	 definition (firstName = "Steve")
	 declare + define in same line (String firstName = "Steve")
	 
	Polymorphism for Interfaces
	 WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver()
	 WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver()
	  *ChromeDriver and FirefoxDriver BOTH implement the SAME WebDriver interface
	  *Therefore, both CD and FD have the same method/function NAMES but DIFFERENT implementation for the specific browser
	  *WebDriver .get() will open a new browser on Firefox or Chrome depending on where WebDriver points
	
	Polymorphism & Overloading
	 Java will NOT allow same function definition (name + argument)
	 Java WILL allow same function name with different argument
	
	Static vs Instance
	 Static - we can call directly without instantiation (uses functions)
	 Instance - we create a new, independent object with its distinct properties (uses methods)
	 
	Browsers: LinkText & Formatting
	 Chrome and IE interpret text post-CSS
	 Firefox interprets text from inner HTML
	 
	Programming Fundamentals
	 Variables - placeholders for data
	 Functions - declared, repeatable, callable code blocks that do work based on input
	 Arrays - ordered data by variable type (String, int) and logical category
	 Loops - repeated same code over again based on condition (While-loop, For-loop) 
	 Control Flow (if statements) - execute different code based on condition
	
	Constructors
	 1. is a public function defined as the same name as the class
	 2. has no return type (no void, no value)
	 3. is implicitly called when a new object is created
